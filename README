Exploring the effects of recombination on Darwinian evolution
in a fluctuating environment.

`doit' is a Bash executable.  The command

./doit input_file

parses the parameters in `input_file', and produces a
visual representation of the results in a file `out.pdf'.

The option `--dump' as in

./doit --dump input_file

outputs a textual representation of the results.

An example input file, `input_file_example.txt', is included, which contains an
explanation of the fields.

For a slightly more technical description, see DESCRIPTION.txt.
